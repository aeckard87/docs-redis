This section provides an introduction to Redis for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) for developers.

## <a id="services"></a>  Redis for PCF Services

Redis for PCF v1.8+ offers On-Demand, Dedicated-VM, and Shared-VM services.

* The On-Demand Service provides a dedicated VM running a Redis instance. The operator can configure up to three plans with different configurations, memory sizes, and quotas.
App developers can provision an instance for any of the On-Demand plans offered and configure certain Redis settings.

* The Dedicated-VM Service provides a dedicated VM running a Redis instance. The Dedicated-VM Service is pre-provisioned by the operator with a fixed number of VMs and memory size.
App developers can then use one of those pre-provisioned VMs.

* The Shared-VM Service provides support for a number of Redis instances running in a single VM. It is designed for testing and development. The Shared-VM instances are pre-provisioned by the
operator with a fixed number of instances and memory size. App developers can then use one of these pre-provisioned instances.

For more information on the plans see the [architecture](./architecture.html) and [recommended usage](./recommended.html) pages.

### <a id="spring"></a>Using Redis for PCF with Spring
<a href="http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-connectors/spring-cloud-spring-service-connector.html#_redis">Spring Cloud Connectors</a> can connect to Redis for PCF. <a href="http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-connectors/spring-cloud-cloud-foundry-connector.html#_redis">Spring Cloud Cloud Foundry connectors</a> will automatically connect to Redis for PCF.

###  <a id="pcf-dev"></a>PCF Dev
PCF Dev is a small footprint version of PCF that's small enough to run on a local developer machine.
