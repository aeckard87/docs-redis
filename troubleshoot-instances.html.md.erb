This topic provides basic instructions for app developers troubleshooting On-Demand Redis for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).

## <a id="about-cli"></a>About the BOSH CLI
The BOSH CLI is available in two major versions, v1 and v2. Pivotal recommends that you use the BOSH CLI v2 when possible.

This topic provides examples of using each version of the BOSH CLI. While all versions of the BOSH CLI work with Redis 1.9, your PCF installation may affect which version of the BOSH CLI you can use. Consult the table below to determine which version of the CLI is supported for your installation.

<table class="nice">
    <th>PCF Version</th>
    <th>BOSH CLI Version</th>
    <tr>
        <td>1.10</td>
        <td>CLI v1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1.11</td>
        <td>CLI v1 or CLI v2 (Pivotal recommends CLI v2)</td>
    </tr>
</table>

## <a id="outages"></a>Temporary Outages

Redis for PCF service instances can become temporarily inaccessible during upgrades and VM or network failures.

## <a id="errors"></a> Errors

You may see an error when using the Cloud Foundry Command-Line Interface (cf CLI) to perform basic operations on a Redis for PCF service instance:

* `cf create`
* `cf update`
* `cf bind`
* `cf unbind`
* `cf delete`

### <a id="parse-error"></a>Parse a Cloud Foundry (CF) Error Message

### <a id="instance"></a> Retrieve Service Instance Information

1. Log into the space containing the instance or failed instance.
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf login
    </pre>

1. If you do not know the name of the service instance, run `cf services` to see a listing of all service instances in the space. The service instances are listed in the `name` column.
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf services
    Getting services in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
    OK
    name          service      plan        bound apps    last operation
    my-instance   p.Redis      db-small                  create succeeded
    </pre>

1. Run `cf service SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME` to retrieve more information about a specific instance.

1. Run `cf service SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME --guid` to retrieve the GUID of the instance, which is useful for debugging.
