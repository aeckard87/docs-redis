This topic provides basic instructions for app developers troubleshooting On-Demand Redis for PCF.

## <a id="outages"></a>Temporary Outages

Redis for PCF service instances can become temporarily inaccessible during upgrades and VM or network failures.

## <a id="errors"></a> Errors

You may see an error when using the Cloud Foundry Command-Line Interface (cf CLI) to perform basic operations on a Redis for PCF service instance:

* `cf create`
* `cf update`
* `cf bind`
* `cf unbind`
* `cf delete`

### <a id="parse-error"></a>Parse a Cloud Foundry (CF) Error Message

<%= partial '../../redis/odb/tshoot-tech-parse-error' %>

### <a id="instance"></a> Retrieve Service Instance Information

1. Log into the space containing the instance or failed instance.
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf login
    </pre>

1. If you do not know the name of the service instance, run `cf services` to see a listing of all service instances in the space. The service instances are listed in the `name` column.
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf services
    Getting services in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
    OK
    name          service      plan        bound apps    last operation
    my-instance   p.Redis      db-small                  create succeeded
    </pre>

1. Run `cf service SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME` to retrieve more information about a specific instance.

1. Run `cf service SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME --guid` to retrieve the GUID of the instance, which is useful for debugging.
