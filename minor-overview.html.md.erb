This topic describes the significant new features in Redis for PCF v1.8.
This topic also presents a checklist that you can use to decide if Redis for PCF is ready to meet your business requirements.

##<a id="intro"></a> Introduction

Redis for PCF v1.8 introduces dynamically provisioned, configurable Redis instances. These instances allow for additional configuration of Redis by both the
Operator and App Developer, and for App Developers to create Redis instances as needed.

## <a id="features"></a>New in This Release

The following features are new in Redis for PCF v1.8:

+ <strong>Operator-enabled plans</strong> — Operators can enabled and configure three service plans for dynamically provisioned instances with different memory and disk sizes.
+ <strong>Operator set properties</strong> - Operators can set select Redis properties for each plan.
+ <strong>Quotas</strong> — Operators can set instance quotas for individual plans as well as globally.
+ <strong>App-Developer provisioned instances</strong> — App Developers can provision an Operator-configured plan from the command line.
+ <strong>App-developer set arbitrary parameters</strong> — App developers can set select Redis properties for each instance.

## <a id="other-notes"></a>About Multiple AZs in Redis for PCF v1.7

Redis for PCF v1.8 supports configuring multiple AZs.
However, assigning multiple AZs to Redis jobs does not guarantee high availability.

+ On-Demand plans can be assigned to any of the configured availability zones.
However each instance still operates as a single node with no clustering.
+ Shared-VM instances run on a single node in just one of the configured availability zones and are therefore not highly available.
+ Dedicated-VM instances can be assigned to any of the configured availability zones.
However each instance still operates as a single node with no clustering.
This separation over availability zones provides no high availability.
