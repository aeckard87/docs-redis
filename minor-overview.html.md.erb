## <a id="other-notes"></a>About Multiple AZs in Redis for PCF v1.7

Redis for PCF v1.7 supports configuring multiple AZs. 
However, assigning multiple AZs to Redis jobs does not guarantee high availability. 

+ Shared-VM instances run on a single node in just one of the configured availability zones and are therefore not highly available. 
+ Dedicated-VM instances can be assigned to any of the configured availability zones. 
However each instance still operates as a single node with no clustering. 
This separation over availability zones provides no high availability.
