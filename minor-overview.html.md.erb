[WHAT IS THIS PAGE ABOUT? It an overview of Redis or PCF or is it an overview of features
new in v.1.6?]

##<id="intro"> Introduction

Redis for PCF v1.6 focuses on increased operability and compatibility with Ops Manager v1.8.  
As of v1.6, metrics are emitted via the Loggregator Firehose. Metrics help operators monitor service health and usage. 
New, enhanced logging provides a fine-grained history of service usage.

## <a id="compatibility"></a>Compatibility [DELETE THIS SECTION BECAUSE COMPATIBILITY IS ON THE INDEX PAGE]

Redis for PCF v1.6 is not compatible with Ops Manager version 1.7 or earlier. 
Versions of Redis earlier than 1.5.17 will not work in Ops Manager 1.8, so it is recommended to upgrade to the latest Redis 1.5.x tile before upgrading to Ops Manager 1.8.

## <a id="features"></a>New in This Release

The following features are new in Redis for PCF v1.6 

+ [Metrics](#metrics)
+ [Syslog forwarding protocols](#syslog-forwarding)
+ [Redis 3.2.1](#Redis 3.2.1)
+ [Extended logging](#extended-logging)
+ [Enhanced smoke tests](#smoke-test-enhancements)

### <a id="metrics"></a>Metrics

Redis emits a number of metrics you can use to monitor the health and performance of your Redis deployment. 
Redis for PCF sends these metrics to the Firehose.
For more information, see <a href="/redis/1-6/monitoring.html">Monitoring Redis for PCF</a>.

Here is an example of an emitted metric.
<pre class='terminal'>
origin:"p-redis" eventType:ValueMetric timestamp:1469004313768976243 deployment:"cf-redis" job:"dedicated-node" index:"65325eae-7de3-4ed0-84c4-0f96c1e33987" ip:"10.0.32.9" valueMetric:<name:"/p-redis/info/stats/pubsub_channels" value:0 unit:"" >
</pre>
For more information, see <a href="/redis/1-6/monitoring.html">Monitoring Redis for PCF</a>.

The metrics polling interval defaults to 30 seconds. This can be changed by navigating to the Metrics configuration page in Ops Manager and entering a new value in Metrics polling interval.

A complete list of metrics is in the <a href="/redis/1-6/monitoring.html">documentation</a>

### <a id="syslog-forwarding"></a>New syslog forwarding protocols

Redis for PCF v1.6 supports new protocols for syslog forwarding: TCP and RELP. The new protocols widen the range of log management tools that can be used. They can be configured on the Syslog tab in Ops Manager.

Documentation for syslog forwarding can be found <a href="/redis/1-6/installing.html#syslog">here</a>.

### <a id="update-redis"></a>Update to Redis 3.2.1

Redis for PCF v1.6 uses Redis 3.2.1, enabling app developers to use the new GEO API and BITFIELD command.

### <a id="extended-logging"></a>Extended Logging

New logging includes service instance creation and deletion: logs are emitted when a service instance is created, via cf create-service p-redis <plan-name> <service-instance-name>, or deleted, via cf delete-service <service-instance-name>.

### <a id="smoke-test-enhancements"></a>Smoke Tests Enhancements

In Redis for PCF v1.6 smoke tests run in a more restrictive ASG in the ‘system’ org and ‘redis-smoke-test-space’. Smoke Tests run as an application instance; the restrictive ASG reduces security vulnerability. Running the tests in ‘system’ ensures the smoke tests don’t count as a billable application instance.

## <a id="bug-fixes"></a>Bug Fixes

Redis for PCF v1.6 fixes an issue with long server names causing Nginx to error, <a href="https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/100807978">as per this tracker story</a>.

## <a id="resolved-security-issues"></a>Resolved Security Issues

Redis for PCF v1.6 uses Golang v1.6.3 as it fixes a HTTPoxy security vulnerability; that particular vulnerability was not present in the product.

## <a id="known-issues"></a>Known Issues

None

## <a id="other-notes"></a>Other Notes

Redis for PCF v1.6 supports configuring multiple AZs. However, assigning multiple AZs to Redis jobs will not guarantee high availability. Shared-VM instances will run on a single node in just one of the configured availability zones and are therefore not highly available. Each Dedicated-VM instance could be assigned to any of the configured availability zones, however each instance still operates as a single node with no clustering. This separation over availability zones provides no high availability.-
