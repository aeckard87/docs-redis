This section describes networking considerations for the Redis for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) on-demand service.

## <a id ="architecture_networks"></a>Default Network and Service Network

Like other on-demand PCF services, on-demand Redis for PCF relies on the BOSH 2.0 ability to dynamically deploy VMs in a dedicated network. The on-demand service broker uses this capability to create single-tenant service instances in a dedicated service network.

The diagram below shows worker VMs in an on-demand service instance, such as RabbitMQ for PCF, running on a separate services network, while other components run on the default network.
