This is documentation for Redis for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).
This tile can be downloaded from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-redis).

This documentation:

+ Describes the features and architecture of Redis for PCF.
+ Instructs the PCF operator on how to install, configure, maintain, and backup Redis for PCF.
+ Instructs the app developer on how to choose a service plan, create and delete Redis service instances, and bind an app.

##<a id="about-redis"></a> About Redis

<strong><em>Redis</em></strong> is an easy to use, high speed key-value store that can be used as a database, cache, and message broker.
It supports a range of data structures including strings, lists, hashes, sets, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, and geospatial indexes.
It is easy to install and configure and is popular with engineers as a straightforward NoSQL data store.
It is used for everything from a quick way to store data for development and testing through to enterprise-scale apps like Twitter.

## <a id="about"></a> About Redis for PCF

<strong><em>Redis for PCF</em></strong> packages Redis for easy deployment and operability on Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).
Redis for PCF can be used as a datastore or cache.
Metrics and logging enable operators to monitor Redis health. Operators can configure scheduled backups to a variety of destinations. There are manual backup and restore scripts for individual service instances.
New features are regularly introduced. Upgrading Redis for PCF is straightforward and preserves configuration and data.

### <a id="odb"></a> On-Demand Service

Redis for PCF v1.8 and later includes on-demand provisioning of Redis instances based on the [On-Demand Services SDK](http://docs.pivotal.io/on-demand-service-broker/).
This enables an app developer to create a Redis instance as needed from the CF CLI through the `cf create-service` command.
The Operator configures the plan options available to the app developers.

#### <a id="service"></a> Three On-Demand Plans

Redis for PCF offers three on-demand plans as the p.redis service within the PCF Redis tile. Below is a description of each plan as it appears in the cf marketplace and its intended use case.

* **Small Cache Plan** — A Redis instance deployed to a dedicated VM, suggested to be configured with ~1&nbsp;GB of memory and >3.5&nbsp;GB of persistent disk.
* **Medium Cache Plan** — A Redis instance deployed to a dedicated VM, suggested to be configured with ~2&nbsp;GB of memory and >10&nbsp;GB of persistent disk.
* **Large Cache** — A Redis instance deployed to a dedicated VM, suggested to be configured with ~4&nbsp;GB of memory and >14&nbsp;GB of persistent disk.

For each service plan, the operator can configure the **Plan name**, **Plan description**, **Server VM type** and **Server Disk type**, or choose to disable the plan completely.

### <a id="shared-dedicated"></a> Dedicated-VM and Shared-VM Services

Redis for PCF still offers Dedicated-VM and Shared-VM plans.
With these plans, an Operator specifies at install time how many dedicated VM Redis instances to create. 
For more information about the dedicated-VM and shared-VM service, see
[Architecture and Lifecycle for Dedicated and Shared Plans]( ./architecture-pp.html).

### <a id="other-notes"></a>Support for Multiple AZs

As of v1.9, Redis for PCF supports configuring multiple AZs.
However, assigning multiple AZs to Redis jobs does not guarantee high availability.

+ On-Demand plans can be assigned to any of the configured availability zones.
However each instance still operates as a single node with no clustering.
+ Shared-VM instances run on a single node in just one of the configured availability zones and are therefore not highly available.
+ Dedicated-VM instances can be assigned to any of the configured availability zones.
However each instance still operates as a single node with no clustering.
This separation over availability zones provides no high availability.
