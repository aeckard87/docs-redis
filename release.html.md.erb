### Known Issues

* The redis-odb service broker listens on port `12345`.
This is inconsistent with other services, but has no effect on tile operations.

* The **When Changed** option for errands has unexpected behavior.
Do not select this choice as an errand run-rule.
For more information about this unexpected behavior, see
[Errand Run Rules](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/tile-errands.html#run-rules).

* Default persistance is set to full persistance where an AOF file grows and is not automatically optimised at any lifecycle stage,
  this can lead to very large persistant disk usage. If you find that your Redis instance has significantly larger persistant disk usage than expected,
  check the size of your `appendonly.aof` file to verify if this is the source of the usage (usually at `/var/vcap/store/redis`).
  This can then be mitigated by running the [BGREWRITEAOF](https://redis.io/commands/bgrewriteaof) command.

## <a id="1100"></a> v1.10.4

**Release Date: February 7, 2018**

### Fixes

## <a id="1100"></a> v1.10.0

**Release Date: October 10, 2017**

### Features

* Includes metrics for the on-demand service. This enables operators to monitor the health of their Redis instances.

* Introduces a new format for on-demand metrics. This is the standard format for all services and will eventually replace other formats.

* Uses a new release for syslog that allows the operator to configure the log format to be either the pre-existing one or RFC5424. RFC5424 is the standard format for PCF services. The previous format will eventually be deprecated.

* Enables TLS encryption for syslog forwarding.

* Lua Scripting defaults to off for all on-demand service plans. Pivotal's security recommendation is to keep Lua Scripting as off.

* Allows the operator to opt-out of the on-demand service without configuring on-demand plans.

### Known Issues

* `lua-timeout-limit`, a Redis configuration that is exposed to app developers through arbitrary parameters, does not have any effect due to a bug in Redis v3.2.8.

* The redis-odb service broker listens on 12345. This is inconsistent with other services.

* The **When Changed** option for errands has [unexpected behavior](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/tile-errands.html) in what changes trigger the errand. Do not select this option for errands.

* Logs for service-backup and service-metrics releases are truncated when syslog is not configured.

* Due to a bug with the properties migration logic, tile upgrades in some PCF installations may be blocked.

* Default persistance is set to full persistance where an AOF file grows and is not automatically optimised at any lifecycle stage,
  this can lead to very large persistant disk usage. If you find that your Redis instance has significantly larger persistant disk usage than expected,
