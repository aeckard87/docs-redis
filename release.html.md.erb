### Features

* Redis version packaged has been updated to 4.0.8,
see [Redis release notes](http://download.redis.io/redis-stable/00-RELEASENOTES) for more details on features introduced.

* Experimental feature added to on demand instances to allow sharing a redis instance with another space.
See [Sharing the redis instance with another space](./using.html#sharing) for more information on the feature.

* Removed tile limit on the maximum number of on-demand instances that can be deployed.

* Tile deployment no longer fails if there are no shared system domains specified.

* The Redis Appendonly File is optimised upon Redis restart for more efficient disk usage.

\* As of PCF v2.0, _Elastic Runtime_ is renamed _Pivotal Application Service (PAS)_.

### Known Issues

* The redis-odb service broker listens on 12345. This is inconsistent with other services.

* The **When Changed** option for errands has [unexpected behavior](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/tile-errands.html) in what changes trigger the errand. Do not select this option for errands.
