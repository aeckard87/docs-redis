## <a id="1130"></a> v1.13.0

**Release Date: XXX XX, 2018**

### Features

* In the Marketplace, "On-Demand Redis" is renamed to "Redis On-Demand" to make it more consistent and searchable.

### Known Issues

* The redis-odb service broker listens on port `12345`. 
This is inconsistent with other services.

* The **When Changed** option for errands has unexpected behavior.
Do not select this choice as an errand run-rule.
For more information about this unexpected behavior, see
[Errand Run Rules](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/tile-errands.html#run-rules).
