**Release Date: December XX, 2017**

### Features

* All releases within tile use SHA-2 checksums.

* Tile uses [colocated errands](http://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/1-12/tile-errands.html) to decrease errand run time and VM footprint for PCF 2.0+.

* Users can manually backup and restore data to on-demand instances.

* Data from dedicated-VM service instances can be migrated to on-demand service instances.

* Reduced permissions to least priveleged user and lowest permissions for all Redis files for the on-demand service.

* Introduces defaults for on-demand VM and disk sizes, encouraging correct configuration and sizing of plans.

### Known Issues

* `lua-timeout-limit`, a Redis configuration that is exposed to app developers through arbitrary parameters, does not have any effect due to a bug in Redis v3.2.8.

* The redis-odb service broker listens on 12345. This is inconsistent with other services.

* The **When Changed** option for errands has [unexpected behavior](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/tile-errands.html) in what changes trigger the errand. Do not select this option for errands.

* Logs for service-backup and service-metrics releases are truncated when syslog is not configured.
