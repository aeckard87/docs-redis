### Features

New features and changes in this release:

## <a id="1120"></a> v1.12.0

**Release Date: April 24, 2018**

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

* Updates the packaged OSS Redis version to v4.0.8. 
For more information about new features in Redis v4.0.8, see the 
[Redis release notes](http://download.redis.io/redis-stable/00-RELEASENOTES).

* Introduces a beta feature for on-demand instances that allows a Redis 
instance to be shared with another space.
For more information on this feature, see 
[Sharing a Redis Instance with Another Space (Beta)](./using.html#sharing).

* There is no longer a limit on the maximum number of on-demand instances that 
can be deployed from the Redis for PCF tile.

* The Redis append-only file is optimized for size when Redis restarts for more efficient disk usage.

* Tile deployment no longer fails if there are no shared system domains because
smoke tests now use the system domain.

* Supports stemcells without Transparent Huge Pages (THP) kernel modules.

* Reintroduces colocated errands for faster deployments.

### Known Issues

* The redis-odb service broker listens on port `12345`.
This is inconsistent with other services.

* The **When Changed** option for errands has unexpected behavior.
Do not select this choice as an errand run-rule.
For more information about this unexpected behaviour, see
[Errand Run Rules](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/tile-errands.html#run-rules).

* The redis-odb fails if arbitrary parameters are changed in an `update-service` command.

* Executing a restore may fail to complete and leave the CONFIG command unaliased.

* Upgrades and stemcell bumps fail if any shared-vms are down or unresponsive.

* AOF rewrite does not occur in the drain script for shared-vms.
