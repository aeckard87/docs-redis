Redis for PCF 1.6 supports configuring multiple AZs. However, assigning multiple AZs to Redis jobs will not guarantee high availability. Shared-VM instances will run on a single node in just one of the configured availability zones and are therefore not highly available. Each Dedicated-VM instance could be assigned to any of the configured availability zones, however each instance still operates as a single node with no clustering. This separation over availability zones provides no high availability.
