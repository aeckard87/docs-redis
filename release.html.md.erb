## <a id="1110"></a> v1.11.0

**Release Date:  January 25, 2018**

### Features

* The on-demand service is now at feature parity with the dedicated-VM service.
The dedicated-VM service will be deprecated. Please move apps to the on-demand service.

* All releases used within the tile use SHA-2 checksums.

* The tile uses [colocated errands](http://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/1-12/tile-errands.html)
to decrease errand runtime and VM footprint for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) v2.0 and later.

* Users can manually and automatically back up and restore data to on-demand instances.

* For security reasons, the permissions for all Redis files for the on-demand
service have been reduced to least privileged user and lowered to minimum needed.

* Defaults for on-demand VM and disk sizes encourage correct configuration and sizing of plans.

* `lua-timeout-limit`, a Redis configuration that is exposed to app developers through arbitrary parameters,
has been disabled for security concerns.

\* As of PCF v2.0, _Elastic Runtime_ is renamed _Pivotal Application Service (PAS)_.

### Known Issues

* The errands for Redis for PCF v1.11.0 might not run successfully on some PCF v1.12 environments.
  The underlying cause is being investigated, and a v1.11.1 patch is planned.

* The redis-odb service broker listens on 12345. This is inconsistent with other services.

* The **When Changed** option for errands has [unexpected behavior](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/tile-errands.html) in what changes trigger the errand. Do not select this option for errands.
