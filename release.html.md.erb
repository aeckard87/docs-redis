## Redis for PCF v1.9.9
**March 7, 2018**

This release updates the stemcell verison.

**Compatibility**

* Compatible with stemcells 3468.25+.

* Compatible with [Service Metrics v1.5.11](https://docs.pivotal.io/svc-sdk/service-metrics/1-5/index.html),
  [Service Backups for PCF v18.1.9](https://docs.pivotal.io/svc-sdk/service-backup/18-1/index.html),
  and [On-Demand Service Broker v0.19.0](http://docs.pivotal.io/svc-sdk/odb/0-19/index.html). 


**Known Issues**

* The redis-odb service broker listens on port `12345`.
  This is inconsistent with other services.

* The **When Changed** option for errands has unexpected behavior.
  Do not select this choice as an errand run-rule.
  For more information about this unexpected behavior,
  see [Errand Run Rules](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/tile-errands.html#run-rules).

* Default persistance is set to full persistance where an AOF file grows and is not automatically optimised at any lifecycle stage,
  this can lead to very large persistant disk usage. If you find that your Redis instance has significantly larger persistant disk usage than expected,
  check the size of your `appendonly.aof` file to verify if this is the source of the usage (usually at `/var/vcap/store/redis`).
  This can then be mitigated by running the [BGREWRITEAOF](https://redis.io/commands/bgrewriteaof) command.

## Redis for PCF v1.9.4
**September 22, 2017**

**Bug Fixes**

* Lua Scripting is disabled by default for the on-demand service. It was previously enabled by default. Pivotal recommends that Lua Scripting be disabled.

* Allows the on-demand broker resource to be set to 0 or 1. This eases the ability of operators to avoid setting up the on-demand service.

**Compatibility**

* Compatible with PCF v1.10.9+.

* Compatible with stemcells 3445.11+. This is a change from the previous stemcell line of 3363.

**Known Issues**

* Due to a bug with the properties migration logic, tile upgrades in some PCF installations may be blocked.

* `lua-timeout-limit`, a Redis configuration that is exposed to app developers through arbitrary parameters in v1.9,  does not have any effect due to a bug in Redis v3.2.8.

* The redis-odb service broker listens on port `12345`.
  This is inconsistent with other services.

* The **When Changed** option for errands has unexpected behavior.
  Do not select this choice as an errand run-rule.
  For more information about this unexpected behavior,

## Redis for PCF v1.9.3
**August 24, 2017**

**Bug Fixes**

* Ensures all eviction policies are enforced when on-demand instance  memory is full.

**Compatibility**

* Uses On-Demand Service Broker v0.17.0

* Compatible with PCF v1.10.9+.

* Uses a Syslog Migration Release that allows the operator to configure the log format to be either the pre-existing one or RFC 5424. RFC 5424 is the standard formatting across PCF services. The previous format will eventually be deprecated.

**Known Issues**

* Due to a bug with the properties migration logic, tile upgrades in some PCF installations may be blocked.

* The on-demand broker cannot be set to 0. This means that the instructions for disabling the on-demand service cannot be followed.

* Tile states it is compatible with OM v1.10.3+ but the minimum is v1.10.9+

* `lua-timeout-limit`, a Redis configuration that is exposed to app developers through arbitrary parameters in v1.9,  does not have any effect due to a bug in Redis v3.2.8.

* The redis-odb service broker listens on port `12345`. This is inconsistent with other services.

* The **When Changed** option for errands has unexpected behavior.

**July 20, 2017**

**Compatibility**

* Compatible with PCF v1.10.9+.

**Bug Fixes**

* On-demand service instances correctly picks up new Redis releases and stemcells when upgraded. This addresses a prior bug where pre-existing instances were not upgrading Redis Releases or Stemcells.

* Upgrades of on-demand service instances from v1.8.0, v1.8.1 and v1.8.2 to v1.9.0 do not take effect.
