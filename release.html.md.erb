## Redis for PCF v1.9.0
**Release Date: June 30, 2017**

* Compatibility: This release is compatible with PCF 1.10.3+.

* The On-Demand Service leverages the [On-Demand Broker v0.16.0](https://docs.pivotal.io/svc-sdk/odb/0-16/release-notes.html)

* There is a slight change in how syslog forwarding is turned off and on via a new toggle.



**Known Issues**

* `lua-timeout-limit` a Redis configuration that is exposed to App Developrs through arbitrary Parameters in 1.9,  will not have any effect due to a bug in Redis 3.2.8.

* Redis smoke tests will fail if the number of instances of a certain plan have reached the global quota. Either remove the smoke tests errand or increase your quota.

* The redis-odb service broker listens on `12345`. This is inconsistent with other services and will be addressed in a future release.

* The 'When Changed' option for errands has unexpected behavior. Operators should not select this choice as an errand.
