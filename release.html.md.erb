## <a id="1.7.2"></a>Redis for PCF v1.7.2

**February 16, 2017**

<strong>Compatibility</strong>

In order for Redis for PCF v1.7 to work with PCF v1.8 and later, the operator needs to be able to configure whether TLS is turned on or off for metrics communications. 
Redis for PCF v1.7.2 adds the ability for the operator to turn on/off TLS communications for
metrics, via a `Use non-secure communication for metrics` checkbox on the metrics configuration
page in Ops Manager. You should configure this checkbox for different versions of PCF as follow:

* **PCF v1.8**: This checkbox must be checked for metrics to be emitted to the
Firehose. 

* **PCF v1.9**: Metrics communications are secure by default but will work in a non-secure mode. 

* **PCF v1.10 and later**: Metrics communications are secure by
default so this checkbox must be unchecked for metrics to be emitted to the Firehose.
