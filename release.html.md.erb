## Redis for PCF 1.8.0
**April 25, 2017**

**Compatibility**

This release is compatible with PCF 1.9+.

Includes Redis 3.2.8.

The redis-broker now listens on port `12350`.

The On-Demand Service leverages the [On-Demand Broker v0.15.2](https://docs.pivotal.io/svc-sdk/odb/0-15/release-notes.html)

TLS is turned on for metric communications.

All Redis instances now have a consul agent co-located for service discovery and DNS.
This means instances need to be able to listen on port `8301`.

**Known Issues**

`lua-timeout-limit` a Redis configuration that is exposed to App Developrs through arbitrary Parameters in 1.8,  will not have any effect due to a bug in Redis 3.2.8.
