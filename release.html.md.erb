## <a id="1130"></a> v1.13.0

**Release Date: June 25, 2018**

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

* In the Marketplace, "On-Demand Redis" is renamed to "Redis On-Demand" to make it more consistent and searchable.

* Added beta support for securing credentials in runtime CredHub.
Credentials are stored in a central repository and are restricted to components that need them.

* Added configuration options for the `upgrade-all-service-instances` errand.
This includes maximum parallel upgrades, number of canaries, and canary selection parameters by org and space.

### Known Issues

This release has the following issues:

* The redis-odb service broker listens on port `12345`. 
This is inconsistent with other services.

* The **When Changed** option for errands has unexpected behavior.
Do not select this choice as an errand run rule.
For more information about this unexpected behavior, see
[Errand Run Rules](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/tile-errands.html#run-rules).
