## Redis for PCF v1.9.0
**June 30, 2017**

**Compatibility**

* This release is compatible with PCF 1.10.3+.

* Includes Redis 3.2.8.

* The On-Demand Service leverages the [On-Demand Broker v0.16.0](https://docs.pivotal.io/svc-sdk/odb/0-16/release-notes.html)

* TLS is turned on for metric communications.

* All Redis instances now have a consul agent co-located for service discovery and DNS. This means instances need to be able to listen on `8301`.

* For the on-demand service, the on-demand Service broker needs to talk to `bosh director`. This requires firewall rules to open TCP `8443` and `25555`.

Op

**Known Issues**

`lua-timeout-limit` a Redis configuration that is exposed to App Developrs through arbitrary Parameters in 1.9,  will not have any effect due to a bug in Redis 3.2.8.

Redis smoke tests will fail if the number of instances of a certain plan have reached the global quota. Either remove the smoke tests errand or increase your quota.
