## Redis for PCF v1.9.3
**August 24, 2017**

**Bug Fixes**

* Ensures all eviction policies are enforced when memory is full for On-Demand instances.

**Compatibility**

* Uses On Demand Service Broker v0.17.0

* Uses a Syslog Migration Release that allows the operator to configure the log format to be either the pre-existing one or RFC 5424. RFC 5424 is the standard formatting across PCF services. The previous format will eventually be deprecated.

**Known Issues**

* `lua-timeout-limit`, a Redis configuration that is exposed to app developers through arbitrary parameters in v1.9,  does not have any effect due to a bug in Redis v3.2.8.

* The redis-odb service broker listens on `12345`. This is inconsistent with other services and will be addressed in a future release.

* The "When Changed" option for errands has unexpected behavior. Operators should not select this choice as an errand.

* Logs for service-backup and service-metrics releases are truncated when syslog is not configured.


## Redis for PCF v1.9.2
**July 20, 2017**

**Bug Fixes**

* On-Demand Service instances correctly picks up new Redis releases and stemcells when upgraded. This addresses a prior bug where pre-existing instances were not upgrading Redis Releases or Stemcells.

* On-Demand smoketests are skipped if the quota for on-demand service instances has been met. This addresses a prior bug where the smoketests would fail if the quota had been met.

* Includes a bug fix in the control script for process-destroyer which prevents process-watcher from restarting periodically (every 10,000 seconds).


**Known Issues**

* `lua-timeout-limit` a Redis configuration that is exposed to app developers through arbitrary parameters in v1.9,  do not have any effect due to a bug in Redis v3.2.8.

* The redis-odb service broker listens on `12345`. This is inconsistent with other services and will be addressed in a future release.

* The "When Changed" option for errands has unexpected behavior. Operators should not select this choice as an errand.

* On-Demand instances may not correctly enforce eviction policies when memory is full.


## Redis for PCF v1.9.0
**Release Date: June 30, 2017**

* Compatibility: This release is compatible with PCF v1.10.9+.

* The On-Demand Service leverages the [On-Demand Broker v0.16.0](https://docs.pivotal.io/svc-sdk/odb/0-16/release-notes.html)

* There is a slight change in how syslog forwarding is turned off and on via a new toggle.


**Known Issues**

* New on-demand service instances does not pick up new stemcells beyond 3363.26.

* A bug exists in the control script for process-destroyer which causes process-watcher to restart periodically (every 10,000 seconds). The bug won't cause problems outside of making it more difficult to distinguish real issues reported by monit.

* New on-demand service instances do not pick up new stemcells beyond 3363.24.

* Upgrades of on-demand service instances from v1.8.0, v1.8.1 and v1.8.2 to v1.9.0 do not take effect.

* `lua-timeout-limit` a Redis configuration that is exposed to app developrs through arbitrary parameters in v1.9,  does not have any effect due to a bug in Redis v3.2.8.

* Redis smoke tests fail if the number of instances of a certain plan have reached the global quota. Either remove the smoke tests errand or increase your quota.

* The redis-odb service broker listens on `12345`. This is inconsistent with other services and will be addressed in a future release.

* The "When Changed" option for errands has unexpected behavior. Operators should not select this choice as an errand.

* On-Demand instances may not correctly enforce eviction policies when memory is full.
