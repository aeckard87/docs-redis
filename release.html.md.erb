## Redis for PCF v1.8.0
**May 5, 2017**

**Compatibility**

This release is compatible with PCF 1.9+.

Includes Redis 3.2.8.

The redis-broker now listens on port `12350`.

The On-Demand Service leverages the [On-Demand Broker v0.15.2](https://docs.pivotal.io/svc-sdk/odb/0-15/release-notes.html)

TLS is turned on for metric communications.

All Redis instances now have a consul agent co-located for service discovery and DNS.
This means instances need to be able to listen on port `8301`.

**Known Issues**

`lua-timeout-limit` a Redis configuration that is exposed to App Developrs through arbitrary Parameters in 1.8,  will not have any effect due to a bug in Redis 3.2.8.

Redis smoke tests will fail if the number of instances of a certain plan have reached the global quota. Either remove the smoke tests errand or increase your quota.

The errand 'Upgrade all On-demand Redis Service Instances' when set to 'When Changed' will not always run when expected. Set the errand 'Upgrade all On-demand Redis Service Instances', located on the errands page, to 'on' to ensure all changes are implemented.

Redis backups to AWS S3 are limited to standard region. Backups are only sent to AWS S3 buckets that have been created in the [US Standard region] (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region), “us-east-1.”

Fails to install if a hostname has been configured for the Director in Ops Manager.
