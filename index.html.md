## Provisioning and Binding via Cloud Foundry

Once you have installed the product, it automatically registers itself with your Elastic Runtime. At this point, the product is available to your application developers, either in the Marketplace in the web based console, or via `cf marketplace`. They can add, provision, and bind the service to their applications like any other CF service:

```
$ cf create-service p-redis shared-vm redis
$ cf bind-service my-application redis
$ cf restart my-application
```

## Example Application
