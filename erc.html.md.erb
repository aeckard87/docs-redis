## <a id="other-notes"></a>Support for Multiple AZs

Redis for PCF supports configuring multiple AZs.
However, assigning multiple AZs to Redis jobs does not guarantee high availability.

+ On-Demand plans can be assigned to any of the configured availability zones.
However, each instance still operates as a single node with no clustering.
+ Shared-VM instances run on a single node in just one of the configured availability zones and are therefore not highly available.
+ Dedicated-VM instances can be assigned to any of the configured availability zones.
However, each instance still operates as a single node with no clustering.
This separation over availability zones provides no high availability.
