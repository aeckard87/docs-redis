<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes the enterprise readiness and recommended use cases of the Redis for PCF service offering.

##<a id="checklist"></a> Enterprise-Ready Checklist

Review the following table to determine if Redis for PCF has the features needed to support your enterprise.

<table border="1" class="nice">

  <tr><th colspan=2>Resilience</th><th>More Information</th></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Availability</td>
    <td>All Redis for PCF services are single nodes without clustering capabilities. This means that during upgrades there can be from 2-10 minutes of downtime, depending on the nature of the upgrade. Unplanned downtime will effect the Redis service.
      Redis for PCF has been used successfully in enterprise ready applications that can tolerate downtime. Pre-existing data will not be lost during downtime with the default persistence configuration.
      Successful applications include those where the downtime is passively handled by the application or applications designed as anti-fragile in which the fail-over logic is written so as to minimize downtime.

  <tr>
    <td>Failure Recovery</td>
    <td>
      VM failures and process failures are handled automatically by BOSH and Redis for PCF.
      Manual back-up and restore instructions are available for all three Redis services.
      Automatic backup capabilities are enabled for the Dedicated-VM service.

    <td>Isolation</td>
    <td>
      <%-#Do we need to cover network isolation?-%>
      Isolation is provided when using the On-Demand and Dedicated-VM service. These single nodes are recommended to support individual applications and workflows.

      Information for preparing an upgrade and understanding the effects on your Redis for PCF and other services can be found [here](./upgrade.html).
      Redis for PCF upgrades run a post deployment BOSH errand called smoke tests that validate the success of the upgrade.

## <a id="other-notes"></a>Support for Multiple AZs

Redis for PCF supports configuring multiple AZs.
However, assigning multiple AZs to Redis jobs does not guarantee high availability.

+ On-Demand plans can be assigned to any of the configured availability zones.
However, each instance still operates as a single node with no clustering.
+ Shared-VM instances run on a single node in just one of the configured availability zones and are therefore not highly available.
+ Dedicated-VM instances can be assigned to any of the configured availability zones.
However, each instance still operates as a single node with no clustering.
This separation over availability zones provides no high availability.
