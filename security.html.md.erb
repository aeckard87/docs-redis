Pivotal recommends that Redis for PCF is run in its own network.
For more information about creating service networks, see [Creating Networks in Ops Manager](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-11/customizing/gcp-om-config.html#network).

Redis for PCF works with the IPsec Add-on for PCF.
For information about the IPsec Add-on for PCF, see [Securing Data in Transit with the IPsec Add-on](https://docs.pivotal.io/addon-ipsec/index.html).

To allow this service to have network access you must create Application Security Groups.
For more information, see [Networks, Security, and Assigning AZs](./installing.html#azs).

Pivotal does not recommend using a single Redis for PCF instance for multi-tenancy.
A single Redis instance of the On-Demand or Dedicated-VM service should support a single workload.
The Shared-VM service is designed for multi-tenancy, but it is not considered adequately secure for production use cases.

Pivotal recommends that you never change the network that a pre-existing Dedicated-VM deployment works with.
If the network is changed, existing dedicated-vm instances will have their bindings stop working with new applications able to bind to the existing instance that contains data.
