## <a id="security"></a> Security 

It is recommended that each service run in its own network.

The following ports and ranges are used in this service:

* Destination port 80 access to the service broker from the cloud controllers
* Destination port 6379 access to all dedicated nodes from the Diego Cell and Diego Brain network(s)
* Destination ports 32768 to 61000 on the service broker from the Diego Cell and Diego Brain network(s). This is only required for the shared service plan.
* Outbound access to your chosen blobstore, typically HTTP 80 or HTTPS 443

###Application Security Groups###

To allow this service to have network access you must create [Application Security Groups (ASGs)](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-7/adminguide/app-sec-groups.html). Ensure your security group allows access to the Redis Service Broker VM and Dedicated VMs configured in your deployment. You can obtain the IP addresses for these VMs in Ops Manager under the <strong>Resource Config</strong> section for the Redis tile.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Without ASGs, this service will not be usable.</p>

#### Application Container Network Connections 

Application containers that use instances of the Redis service require the following outbound network connections:

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th>Destination</th>
<th>Ports</th>
<th>Protocol</th>
<th>Reason</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>ASSIGNED_NETWORK</code></td>
<td>32768-61000</td>
<td>tcp</td>
<td>Enable application to access shared vm service instance</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>ASSIGNED_NETWORK</code></td>
<td>6379</td>
<td>tcp</td>
<td>Enable application to access dedicated vm service instance</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

Create an ASG called `redis-app-containers` with the above configuration and bind it to the appropriate space or, to give all started apps access, bind to the `default-running` ASG set and restart your apps. Example:

```
[
  {
    "protocol": "tcp",
    "destination": "<code>ASSIGNED_NETWORK</code>",
    "ports": "6379"
  }
]
```
