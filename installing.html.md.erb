## Installation Steps

To add Redis for PCF to Ops Manager, follow the procedure for adding Pivotal Ops Manager tiles:

1. Download the product file from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-redis).
1. Upload the product file to your Ops Manager installation.
1. Click **Add** next to the uploaded product description in the Available Products view to add this product to your staging area.
1. (Optional) Click the newly added tile to configure your possible service plans configure and [syslog draining](#syslog).
1. Click **Apply Changes** to install the service.


Select the **Redis** tile from the Installation Dashboard to display the configuration page and configure the Redis service plans.

### Shared-VM Plan

1.  Select the **Shared-VM Plan** tab to configure the memory limit for each Redis instance and the maximum number of instances that can be created.

    <br />Shared-VM instances run on the Redis Broker.

    <br />The memory and instance limits for your Shared-VM Redis instances should depend on the total memory of your Redis broker.
    When configuring the maximum number of Redis service instances that can be created, 
you need to take into account the maximum memory each Redis instance could use in correlation with how much total memory the Redis broker has.
    Pivotal recommends that you only allow up to 45% of your Redis broker's total memory to be used by all Redis instances.
    This is due the amount of memory required to support Redis persistence and run Redis broker and system tasks.

    <br />See below for example cases:

    <table border="1" class="nice">
    	<tr>
    		<th>Redis Broker Total Memory</th>
    		<th>Redis Instance Memory Limit</th>
    		<th>Redis Service Instance Limit</th>
    	</tr>
    	<tr>
    	 	<td>16 GB</td>
    	 	<td>512 MB</td>
    	 	<td>14</td>
     	</tr>
      <tr>
    	 	<td>16 GB</td>
    	 	<td>256 MB</td>
    	 	<td>28</td>
     	</tr>
      <tr>
    	 	<td>64 GB</td>
    	 	<td>512 MB</td>
    	 	<td>56</td>
     	</tr>
    </table>


    <br />It is possible to configure a larger Redis Service Instance Limit, if you are confident that the majority of the deployed instances will not be using a large amount of their allocated memory, for example in development or test environments.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>:
      This is not supported, and could cause your server to run out of memory.
      If this happens your users may not be able to write any further data to any Redis instance.
    </p>


1.  Select the **Resource Config** tab to change the allocation of resources for the Redis Broker.
    <br />The Redis Broker server will run all of the Redis instances for your Shared-VM plan. From this screen you may increase or decrease the CPU, RAM, Ephemeral Disk & Persistent Disk made available, as required.

1.  Click the **Save** button.

### Dedicated-VM Plan

1.  Select the **Resource Config** tab to change the allocation of resources for the Dedicated Node.

    <br />By default, 5 dedicated nodes will be created, each capable of running one Redis instance. You can increase or decrease the number of dedicated nodes, the size of the Persistent and Ephemeral Disks, and the CPU and RAM, as required.

1.  Click the **Save** button.

## Configuring Syslog Output

Pivotal recommends that operators configure a syslog output.

1. Select the **Syslog** tab to setup the details of your syslog draining.
1.  Add the Syslog address and Syslog port of your log management tool.

    The information required for these fields will be provided by your log management tool.

1.  Click the **Save** button.
