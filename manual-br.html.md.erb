## <a id="triggering"></a>Triggering a Manual Backup for shared-vm, dedicated-vm

Backups of your Redis deployment will automatically occur per the Cron Schedule you set in your deployment. You can trigger manual backups at any time by following the steps below. The backup artifacts will be sent to the destination configured in Ops Manager for automatic backups.

1. [Follow these steps](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#ssh) to ssh onto your Ops Manager installation.
1. [Retrieve](maintain.html#identify-p-redis) the deployment name of the installed Redis for PCF tile.
1. Identify the node which holds your instance by running `bosh2 vms`.
  * For the `shared-vm` plan this will be the job name containing `cf-redis-broker`. Running `manual-backup` will back up all of the shared-VM instances and the broker state in the `statefile.json` file.
  * For the `dedicated-vm` plan this will be the job name containing `dedicated-node`. Running `manual-backup` will back up the Redis dump.rdb file for that dedicated-VM instance.
  * You can identify the exact node for your `dedicated-vm` or on-demand service instance by comparing the IP Address from your application bindings. The IP can be found by running `cf env <APP_BOUND_TO_REDIS_INSTANCE>` and finding the corresponding host IP to your service instance. If you don't have an app bound to the dedicated instance, a service key can yield the host `cf create-service-key <DEDICATED_SERVICE_INSTANCE> mykey && cf service-key <DEDICATED_SERVICE_INSTANCE> mykey`

An example output from `bosh2 vms`:

![OpsManager VMs view](bosh_vms.png)

* `bosh2 -d <redis-deployment-name> ssh <node>`, where `<node>` is the instance VM you wish to back up, or the `cf-redis-broker` node for a `shared-vm` instance.

After you have connected to the node, a manual backup can be triggered with these steps:

1. Switch to root using `sudo -i`.
1. Run `/var/vcap/jobs/service-backup/bin/manual-backup`
  * Note: This will only succeed if you have configured backups in the tile

## <a id="triggering-on-demand"></a>Triggering a Manual Backup for an on-demand instance

On-demand instances do not yet support backing up to a remote endpoint. However you can create a snapshot of the data on the instance by following the below steps:

1. [Follow these steps](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#ssh) to ssh onto your Ops Manager installation.
1. Identify your service instance guid by running `cf service <ON_DEMAND_SERVICE_INSTANCE> --guid`. The deployment name will be `service-instance_<ON_DEMAND_SERVICE_INSTANCE_GUID>`.
1. SSH onto your service instance with `bosh2 -d service-instance_<ON_DEMAND_SERVICE_INSTANCE_GUID> ssh`. There is no need to specify the instance because each service instance deployment contains only a single instance.
1. Create a snapshot by running `sudo /var/vcap/jobs/redis-backup/bin/backup --snapshot`
This should create a new rdb file in `/var/vcap/store/redis-backup`.

#### Notes

Triggering a manual backup of a large dump.rdb could take sufficiently long that your SSH connection will timeout. Ensure that you have given yourself enough of a timeout to complete the backup.

Back ups are currently not available for On-Demand instances.

As of v1.8.2, backups can be to all AWS S3 regions (previously limited to the standard region, us-east-1). This requires specifying the region of your backup and the signature version used for your region. You can find this information [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region). In most cases the default signature version will be sufficient.


## Making Your Own Backups

It is possible to create a back up of a Redis instance by hand, bypassing the automated backup tool altogether.

Persistence is enabled on these plans through the use of `RDB` files, using the following Redis config rules:
<pre class=terminal>
save 900 1
save 300 10
save 60 10000
</pre>

### Shared-VM Plan

You can either take the latest RDB file held on disk, which is generated by the above the rules, or trigger a recent update by using the `redis-cli` to trigger a `BGSAVE`. Credentials to log in to the `redis-cli` can be obtained from `VCAP_SERVICES` for your bound application.

The `redis-cli` is located in `/var/vcap/packages/redis/bin/redis-cli`.

On this plan, the `BGSAVE` command is aliased to a random string. This can be obtained from Ops Manager in the credentials tab.

#### Steps to Backup

1. `bosh2 ssh` into your desired node. See the above section on [identifying the correct VM](#triggering).
1. Change to root using `sudo -i`.
1. Copy the contents of the `/var/vcap/store/cf-redis-broker` directory to a .zip or .tar file.
1. Backup the folder / compressed file to your chosen location.

The `/var/vcap/store/cf-redis-broker` has sub-directories for each instance created of this plan. The backup file for each instance is called `dump.rdb`.

For example, here are two instances:
<pre class=terminal>
root@66358f3e-3428-46df-9bb3-9acc7770b188:/var/vcap/store/cf-redis-broker# find -type f | xargs ls -1
./redis-data/3124f373-e9e2-44e1-ad12-a8865d8978b0/db/dump.rdb
./redis-data/3124f373-e9e2-44e1-ad12-a8865d8978b0/redis.conf
./redis-data/3124f373-e9e2-44e1-ad12-a8865d8978b0/redis-server.pid
./redis-data/62333bf9-f023-4566-b233-6686f26b8f4d/db/dump.rdb
./redis-data/62333bf9-f023-4566-b233-6686f26b8f4d/redis.conf
./redis-data/62333bf9-f023-4566-b233-6686f26b8f4d/redis-server.pid
./statefile.json
</pre>

### Dedicated-VM Plan

You can either take the latest RDB file on disk, as generated by the above rules, or trigger a more recent RDB file by executing the `BGSAVE` command using the `redis-cli`. Credentials can be obtained from the `VCAP_SERVICES` from your bound application.
The `redis-cli` can be found in `/var/vcap/packages/redis/bin/redis-cli`.

#### Steps to Backup

* `bosh2 ssh` into your desired node. See the above section on [identifying the correct VM](#triggering).
* Change to root using `sudo -i`.
* Copy the contents of the `/var/vcap/store/redis` directory to a .zip or .tar file.
* Backup the folder / compressed file to your chosen location.

The backup file will be named `dump.rdb`.

## <a id="restore"></a>Restore Redis Instance from a Backup

### To a Local System
You can choose to restore the RDB file to a local Redis instance.

The steps to do this depend on your configuration and setup.
Refer to the [Redis documentation](http://redis.io/documentation) for more details.

### To Pivotal Cloud Foundry

You can also restore your backup file to another instance of the `Redis for PCF` tile.

#### Prerequisites

* Same resource configuration as the instance from which you backed up.
* Ensure that the persistent disk is large enough to accommodate the temporary files used during the restore process. It should be **3.5x the amount of RAM in the VM**.

To restore your backup file to another instance of a `Redis for PCF` tile service instance:

1. Create a new instance of the plan that you wish to restore to.
1. Identify the VM which the instance of your plan is located on by following the steps from the `Manual Backups` section above. If you are restoring an instance of `shared-vm`, this VM is the broker VM.
1. `bosh2 ssh` into the identified VM. This is the broker VM if restoring a `shared-vm` instance.

Redis for PCF v1.7 and later provides a script to automatically restore data in a newly provisioned Redis instance.

#### Preparation
1. Transfer your backup RDB file to a local path on the VM (`PATH-TO-RDB-BACKUP-ON-VM` has to be under `/var/vcap/store`.
1. To verify that the RDB file hasn't been corrupted, run `md5sum PATH-TO-RDB-BACKUP-ON-VM` and compare it against the contents of the `.md5` file named after the backup file. The values should be the same. The `.md5` file is located in the same bucket as the original backup file.
1. Switch to root user `sudo su`

### Dedicated-VM Plan
The restore script will restore the data for the specified dedicated-VM instance.

#### Execution
1. Run `/var/vcap/jobs/redis-backups/bin/restore --sourceRDB PATH-TO-RDB-BACKUP-ON-VM`
1. Tail the script logs at `/var/vcap/sys/log/redis-backups/redis-backups.log` to see progress. When the data restore has been successfully completed, you will see the message `Redis data restore completed successfully`

#### Debugging

The data restore script runs the steps listed below. It logs its process along the way and provides helpful messages in case of failure.

The script logs at `/var/vcap/sys/log/redis-backups/redis-backups.log`. <br />
If a step has failed, resolve the reason that caused it to fail and execute the failed step and every next step manually.
You can retrieve `{instance_password}` through the binding to your service instance: `cf service-key {instance_name} {key_name}`

Run `/var/vcap/packages/redis/bin/redis-cli -a {instance_password} BGREWRITEAOF`
1. **`RewriteAOF`** <br />
Run `watch "/var/vcap/packages/redis/bin/redis-cli -a {instance_password} INFO | grep aof_rewrite_in_progress"` until `aof_rewrite_in_progress` is `0`
1. **`StopAll`** <br />
Run `monit stop all`
1. **`WaitForStop`** <br />

## <a id="recovery"></a>Recovering Redis Instances

In the event of a recovery of Cloud Foundry, it is possible to recover bound
Redis instances to healthy states that are in sync with Cloud Foundry. There are
a few caveats to being able to recover previous instance state fully that
depend on your plan.

### Shared-VM Plan Caveats

* You need a backed up RDB Redis dump file - this would be stored in your S3
buckets if you have backups configured.
* You need a backed up `/var/vcap/store/cf-redis-broker/redis-data` directory
from the service broker node. You do not need to backup and `*.aof` or
`*.rdb` files from subdirectories if you have backups configured.

### Dedicated-VM Plan Caveats

* You need a backed up RDB Redis dump file - this would be stored in your S3
buckets if you have backups configured.
* You need a backed up `/var/vcap/store/redis/statefile.json` from the service
broker node.

### Note

This procedure assumes that a recovery of service information and service keys
assigned to instances are restored with a restore of Cloud Foundry.

### Recovery Procedure

After redeploying Redis, take the following steps.

#### Shared-VM Plan

1. `bosh2 ssh` into the service broker node of your Redis deployment.
1. Run `monit stop all && pkill redis-server`
1. Wait for monit services to enter the `not monitored` state, you can watch
this with `watch monit summary`
1. Confirm no running instances of `redis-server` with
`ps aux | grep redis-server`
1. Copy the backed up `redis-data` directory into `/var/vcap/store/cf-redis-broker`
1. Follow the instructions [here](#restore) for your plan, skipping the first
four steps described here, for restoring your backed up Redis data.
1. Your Redis instance is now recovered.

#### Dedicated-VM Plan

1. `bosh2 ssh` into the service broker node of your Redis deployment.
1. Run `monit stop all`
1. Wait for monit services to enter the `not monitored` state, you can watch
this with `watch monit summary`
1. Copy the backed up `/var/vcap/store/cf-redis-broker/statefile.json` and
ensure ownership and permissions are correct with
`chown vcap:vcap /var/vcap/store/redis/dump.rdb && chmod 660 /var/vcap/store/redis/dump.rdb`
1. Follow the instructions [here](#restore) for your plan, skipping the first three steps
described here, for restoring your backed up Redis data.
1. Your Redis instance is now recovered.
